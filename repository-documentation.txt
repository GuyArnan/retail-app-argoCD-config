GitOps repository for the retail-store-sample-app final project
Made by Guy Arnan - submission 8/12/2025
---------------------

* This repo was set up to hold argoCD manifests for each of the project services (ui, cart, checkout, orders, catalog)
* Each services has its own Chart.yaml template file and two sets of values.yaml. The default values are provided under values.yaml, and another configuration file specific for a dev environment exists as well

Designed deployment flow:
1. A change is made to the /src folder of the source GH repo and is pushed to main. This triggers the GH action CI phase
2. The GH action workflow builds new Docker images for any chnages services (and only them) before pushing each to its respective ECR repository. The images are tagged with the commit SHA
3. The second phase of the same workflow writes the new images tags into the values.yaml files for the changed services in the GitOps repository (the one this document resides within)
4. Whilst monitoring the GitOps repository, ArgoCD detects the changed imaged tags and marks the changed services as OutOfSync
5. ArgoCD syncs the cluster to the desired state, rolling the Deployments to use the new images from ECR, thereby completing the deployment of the updated services
